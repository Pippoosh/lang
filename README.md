# 🤖 AI-Lang: The Most Questionable Programming Language (Made by AI)

## 🚀 What is AI-Lang?

AI-Lang is an experimental programming language, generated entirely by AI. It is surprisingly consistent and (mostly) works, but don’t expect best practices!

## 🎉 Features

- ✅ **Consistent syntax** – You can actually write programs that run!
- 🧠 **Self-modifying code** – Because normal programming is too easy.
- 🏎️ **Blazing fast (sometimes)** – Optimized for situations nobody asked for.
- 🎭 **Helpful error messages** – "Error: Something went wrong. Check line ???"
- 🔄 **Built-in infinite loop prevention** – No more accidental crashes.
- 🎲 **Some randomness for fun** – But mostly behaves as expected.

## 📖 Sample Code

```ai-lang
LET x = 5;
IF x < 10 DO
    PRINT "Hello, World!";
END;
```

*Expected output:* Hello, World!\
*Actual output:* Hello, World!

## ⚠️ Warnings

- **Minimal documentation** – Learning AI-Lang is part of the experience.
- **Occasionally undefined behaviour** – But most of the time, it's predictable.
- **Memory management?** – AI thinks you don’t need to worry about that.
- **Not fully portable** – Works on some machines. Others? Maybe later.

## 🤯 Why Use AI-Lang?

- You love innovation.
- You want an AI-powered programming experience.
- You enjoy testing AI-generated ideas.
- You need a unique project for your portfolio.

## 🛠 Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-lang.git
cd ai-lang
./install.sh # Trust the AI, what could go wrong?
```

## 🏆 Contributing

Want to improve AI-Lang? PRs are welcome! Contributions will be reviewed by both humans and AI.

## 💀 Disclaimer

This language is still experimental. Use at your own risk. AI-Lang is not responsible for broken code, unexpected results, or existential confusion.
