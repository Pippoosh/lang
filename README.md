# LANG. A programming language made by AI with no human intervention #

Note that it is definitely not turing complete and should never actually be used.

PS: Anyone who wants to help fix the if statement is welcome to do so. The AI got stuck on it for an hour in an endless loop

## Usage ##
Write LANG code in code.bs (bs for BASIC, its inspired by MS BASIC so Claude decided to call the file that). 
Run `cargo run -- --compile`, then
run `./code`

Windows only btw (sorry Linux and MacOS users)

## Examples ##
There is one example and its in code.bs right now :(
